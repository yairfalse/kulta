## What is This?

A Kubernetes controller for progressive delivery (canary rollouts) - **built to learn Rust and K8s controllers**.

This is an **early-stage learning project**. I'm building it to understand:
- How Kubernetes controllers work (kube-rs)
- Rust async programming (tokio)
- Progressive delivery patterns
- Gateway API routing

**Current Status**: Basic canary rollout functionality working, actively being developed.

---

## What Actually Works

**Implemented (as of now)**:
- ✅ Custom Resource Definition (Rollout CRD)
- ✅ Controller reconciliation loop
- ✅ ReplicaSet management (stable + canary)
- ✅ Gateway API HTTPRoute traffic splitting
- ✅ Automatic step progression through canary stages
- ✅ Time-based pause durations (`pause: { duration: "5m" }`)
- ✅ Manual promotion support (indefinite pauses)
- ✅ 36 unit tests passing

**Example Rollout**:
```yaml
apiVersion: kulta.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.25
  strategy:
    canary:
      stableService: my-app-stable
      canaryService: my-app-canary
      steps:
      - setWeight: 20   # Start with 20% canary traffic
        pause:
          duration: "5m"  # Wait 5 minutes
      - setWeight: 50   # Move to 50% canary traffic
        pause: {}       # Indefinite pause (manual promotion required)
      - setWeight: 100  # Complete rollout
      trafficRouting:
        gatewayAPI:
          httpRoute: my-app-route
```

**Manual promotion** (for indefinite pauses):
```bash
kubectl annotate rollout my-app kulta.io/promote=true
```

**What happens**:
1. Controller creates stable and canary ReplicaSets
2. Updates HTTPRoute weights (80/20 split)
3. Waits 5 minutes
4. Updates HTTPRoute weights (50/50 split)
5. Waits for manual promotion
6. Updates HTTPRoute weights (0/100 - fully canary)
7. Rollout complete

## Not Yet Implemented

**Planned but not built**:
- Prometheus metrics analysis
- Automated rollback on errors
- Blue-green deployments
- Health checking integration
- CDEvents emission

These are learning goals, not promises. I'm building features as I learn the concepts.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yairfalse/kulta
cd kulta

# Build
cargo build --release

# Generate CRD
cargo run --bin gen-crd > /tmp/rollout-crd.yaml

# Install CRD in your cluster
kubectl apply -f /tmp/rollout-crd.yaml

# Install Gateway API CRDs (required)
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.2.0/standard-install.yaml

# Run controller locally (requires KUBECONFIG)
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin kulta

# Apply example rollout
kubectl apply -f examples/basic-rollout.yaml
```

**Requirements**:
- Rust 1.75+
- Kubernetes cluster (kind/minikube/real cluster)
- Gateway API CRDs
- A Gateway API implementation (like RAUTA, or any other)

---

## Why Gateway API?

I'm using Gateway API for traffic routing instead of a service mesh because:
- **Simpler**: Just HTTPRoute weight changes, no sidecars
- **Transparent**: `kubectl get httproute` shows traffic splits
- **Standard**: K8s sig-network official API

---

## Architecture

```
User applies Rollout YAML
    ↓
KULTA Controller reconciles
    ├─ Creates stable ReplicaSet
    ├─ Creates canary ReplicaSet
    ├─ Updates HTTPRoute weights
    └─ Progresses through steps
    ↓
Gateway API implementation (RAUTA, etc.)
    ↓
Routes traffic based on weights
```

---

## Development

### Build and Test

```bash
# Build
cargo build

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Format
cargo fmt

# Lint
cargo clippy
```

### TDD Workflow

I'm following Test-Driven Development:
1. Write failing test (RED)
2. Minimal implementation (GREEN)
3. Refactor
4. Commit

Check `docs/design/` for implementation plans.

## Tech Stack

- **tokio** - Async runtime
- **kube-rs** - Kubernetes API client
- **gateway-api** - Gateway API CRD types
- **chrono** - Timestamp handling for pauses
- **serde** - Serialization

---

## Naming

**Kulta** (Finnish: "gold") - Part of my Finnish tool naming theme:
- **RAUTA** (iron) - Gateway API routing
- **KULTA** (gold) - Progressive delivery

---

## Current Focus

Right now I'm working on:
- Getting time-based pauses working reliably
- Testing with real deployments in kind
- Understanding controller patterns better

This is a **learning project** - I'm figuring things out as I go. Code quality will improve as I learn more Rust and K8s patterns.
